#### I took my time with the project because I was learning new material.

## About the project

In this project, I tried to copy the site Rozetka as far as I have managed to judge you. Ready to listen to constructive criticism.

## Documentation

1. Brought categories, products, brands (and binding itself between them)
2. Search the site : by name, by product code
3. Js made in a separate file
4. Enabled the MySQL database
5. Reworked the model in his project because I figured that a lot of redundant fields, which are repeated in other models based on the principle of KISS (make your code easier) and the principle of Dry (do not repeat)
6. Made the site multilingual. Presented such languages as russian and English.
7. Registration on the site using django-allauth library (in the next project I will connect registration through social networks)
8. I added asynchrony in the form of sending a payment message using celery and redis (in the next project I will try RabbitMQ connections)
9. I added Dockerfile and docker-compose (tried to configure communication between containers)

## P.S. 
In my next project, I will improve my skills on Dockerfile and asynchrony in my project.
