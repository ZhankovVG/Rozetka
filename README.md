## About the project

At this stage of Rozetka site development these actions were done:
- In this project I connected venv and will work this way in the future.
- Just hid the secret key because it is a must (but so far an error occurs in the future I will figure it out)
- Enabled the MySQL database
- Js made in a separate file
- Brought categories, products, brands (and binding itself between them)
- Create an admin panel
- Reworked the model in his project because I figured that a lot of redundant fields, which are repeated in other models based on the principle of KISS (make your code easier) and the principle of Dry (do not repeat)
- Just redid the admin panel
